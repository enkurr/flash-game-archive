# Flash Game Archive
 A collection of some of the most famous flash games, or at least the ones that I played a lot.


None of the games here are owned by me, it is simply just a collection of the ones I personally thought I should document.


This was meant to just be a personal thing, but I thought it would be good to post it here nevertheless.


Install Directions:

1. Download the folders with the SWF files in them
2. Open the "flashplayer_32_sa_debug.exe" file
3. Select "Open" and then select the flash game you want to play.
